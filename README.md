## Quartz Reflow Fabricator

## Description
A touch screen operated Reflow Oven controlled by Arduino Pro Nano, featuring a Nextion HMI TFT LCD Resistive Touch Display Module.

This project incorporates a myriad of skill sets including Electronic Engineering, Electrical, Light Fabrication, 3D Printing, UI Design, C++ and Hex programming.

Whilst this can be a fun and challenging project for the intermediate experienced maker, this project is not intended to be pursued by makers without fundamental electrical & electronics understanding and experience. Proceed at your own risk.

## Features
- Colorful Touchy Screen
- Fancy Pants Graphics
- Leaded, Lead Free, and 3 Programable Reflow Preset Modes
- A Cool YouTube Video Walkthrough
- Built-In Bacon Burning Quartz Heating Elements (JK, don't cook anything in this besides PCBs!)

# WARNING: Fabricate at your own risk!
## Mangy Industries is not responsible for lost, missing, or exploited digits (fingers) due to the use, or misuse, of this Quartz Reflow Fabricator.

# Seriously...
## Handling mains voltage is dangerous! Always use proper PPE and safety procedure while fabricating this fabricator, or fabricating with this fabricator.

## Personal Note:
I do not condone the business practices of Nextion. I had this HMI TFT Display taking up perfectly good junk drawer space and it simply worked a charm for this project. Watch my YouTube video for deeper insight to this subject.
